# Bechdel_test
Using data visualization to evaluate gender and race representation in movies.

In this project I’ll use data visualization techniques to analyze how the top 50 movies of 2016 performed according to the Bechdel Test and other representation-based tests.

The Bechdel-Wallace Test — often abbreviated to the “Bechdel Test” — evaluates movies based on two simple questions:

Does the movie have at least two named female characters?
And do those characters have at least one conversation that is not about a man?
